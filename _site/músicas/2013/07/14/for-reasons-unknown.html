<p>Por hoje fica uma música.</p>
<blockquote><p>I said if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind.<br />
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to.<br />
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more.<br />
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to,<br />
And my eyes don’t recognize you at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Killers - For Reasons Unknown</p>
